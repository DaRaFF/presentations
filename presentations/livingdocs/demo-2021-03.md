### Media Asset Upload via Streams

[Pull Request](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3396)

- Video: 100MB
- Memory with Buffer: **~300 MB**
- Memory with Streams: **~5 MB**

### Upload with Buffers

1. `POST /videos/upload`
2. Create `Buffer` (Buffer is in memory)
3. Wait until the whole file has been transferred into a Buffer
4. Upload Buffer to storage, release memory

What happens when we try to upload a lot of videos/images at the same time?

# BOOM :-)

### Upload with Streams

1. `POST /videos/upload`
2. Create write stream, store asset into tmp file
3. Create read stream of tmp file
4. Upload Buffer to storage

-> Improvement: don't use tmp file, only use streams
